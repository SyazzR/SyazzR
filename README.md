### Hi there, I'am Fyera ðŸ‘‹


ðŸ”­ Hello, Iâ€™m a recent software engineering graduate with a genuine passion for web development, particularly in the realm of front-end technologies.
During my academic journey, I had the opportunity to work on various projects that have honed my skills in web technology such as HTML, ReactJS, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, CSS, SQL, Python and Flask. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently doing development in front-end technologies using Python and its framework. After enrolling in Python programming bootcamp, I was able to broaden my versatility on front-end.

ðŸ‘¯ I'm excited about the prospect of collaborating with like-minded professionals and contributing my technical skills and creativity to projects that make a real impact in the web development arena.
